**About me**

I’m an AI/ML scientist and engineer working at the intersection of healthcare, life sciences, and venture incubation. My work focuses on building and evaluating AI models and systems for biomedical and clinical use, often in close collaboration with researchers, clinicians, and engineers. More recently, I’ve been increasingly focused on AI for scientific discovery, particularly in life sciences and biotech, including the evaluation and benchmarking of agentic AI workflows for scientific discovery.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from The George Washington University (GWU) under the supervision of [Dr. Mona Diab](https://lti.cmu.edu/people/faculty/diab-mona.html) and [Dr. David Broniatowski](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/david-broniatowski). My dissertation focused on *Advancing Identification of Causal Relations in Natural Language*. I worked on several projects, including building large language models (LLMs) with commonsense reasoning and causal relation understanding capabilities, as well as analytical frameworks for understanding how individuals make decisions on social media, including the spread of disinformation and misinformation.
