**About me**

I’m currently a Venture Fellow / Scientist-in-Residence at [Camford Capital](https://www.camford.vc/) where I work with an interdisciplinary team
on several internal innovative initiatives related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing/Understanding (NLP/NLU)
in the biomedical, clinical, and biological domains.

Prior to joining Camford Capital, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at The George Washington University (GWU)
under the supervision of [Dr. Mona Diab](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/222228496/mona-diab)
and [Dr. David Broniatowski](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/david-broniatowski). My dissertation was on “Advancing
Identification of Causal Relations in Natural Language”. I worked on several projects including building large language
models (LLMs) with commonsense reasoning and causal relation understanding capabilities, and analytical frameworks for
understanding how individuals make various decisions on social media, including the spread of disinformation and
misinformation.
