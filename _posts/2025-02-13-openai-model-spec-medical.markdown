With [OpenAI’s release of Model Spec](https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html), I took a closer look at its
relevance in developing medical AI assistants. By reviewing the principles outlined in the Model Spec—and considering
the high stakes and complexities of using AI in healthcare—having a well-defined Model Spec appears to be an important
step toward ensuring models behave as intended, maintaining transparency, and aligning with ethical and regulatory
standards.

At its core, a Model Spec outlines the expected behavior of an AI model, helping clarify what it should and shouldn’t
do. This is particularly important in medical AI, where precision, reliability, and responsible handling of sensitive
topics are essential. Below, I’ll walk through and summarize some examples from OpenAI’s Model Spec that are directly
relevant to building AI-powered medical assistants.

## Providing Information Without Giving Advice

A key principle for AI models in medical contexts is to provide useful information without overstepping into regulated
medical advice. For instance, if a user describes feeling dizzy, the assistant should not attempt to diagnose them.
Instead, the model should provide general information about potential causes of dizziness—such as dehydration or low
blood pressure—and encourage the user to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment. This
approach ensures users get valuable insights while reinforcing the importance of medical expertise.

## Handling Mental Health Conversations with Care

Similarly, AI models should approach mental health topics with sensitivity. If a user expresses suicidal thoughts, the
model should acknowledge their feelings, respond with understanding, and encourage seeking professional help. Providing
crisis resources or helpline information can be an appropriate way to assist while ensuring the model doesn’t attempt to
act as a therapist.

## Respecting Autonomy While Staying Helpful

Another important expectation for AI assistants is maintaining a balance between respecting user autonomy and ensuring
productive, helpful conversations. If a model detects that a user’s line of questioning contradicts their broader
goals—such as seeking self-improvement or factual learning—it can flag the concern in a neutral and respectful manner.
However, once the user acknowledges this, the assistant should respect their decision and not become overly persistent
or argumentative.

## Generating Sensitive Content in the Right Context

Medical AI models also need to handle sensitive content—such as discussions involving graphic medical
conditions—responsibly. The Model Spec suggests that such content should be generated only when it serves a clear
purpose (e.g., educational) or aligns with the user’s specific request, such as in a transformation case like
translating a medical document that may already contain restricted or sensitive content. This principle helps prevent
unnecessary exposure to distressing material while ensuring that users get the information they need.

## Key Takeaways

While many principles in the Model Spec apply across all domains—for example, maximizing helpfulness or minimizing
harm—medical AI comes with additional responsibilities. Here are a few takeaways for designing AI assistants in this
space:

- **Inform, Don’t Diagnose** – AI should provide helpful medical information while avoiding direct diagnoses or
  treatment recommendations.
- **Support, Don’t Overstep** – When handling sensitive topics like mental health, the model should be empathetic, offer
  supportive resources, and avoid making clinical judgments.
- **Respect the User’s Intent** – The model should assist users in a way that aligns with their goals while ensuring
  conversations remain constructive.
- **Handle Sensitive Content Responsibly** – AI should generate medically sensitive content only when explicitly
  requested or serving a clear purpose, such as for educational use or in transformation cases, like translating a
  medical document that already contains sensitive content.

By adhering to these principles and building upon them—while also considering additional factors—we can develop medical
AI assistants that are not just functional but also ethical, transparent, and genuinely useful to those seeking
information. OpenAI’s Model Spec is a good starting point for defining a more specialized model specification tailored
to the medical and clinical domains, considering the unique challenges these areas present compared to general-purpose
AI. When developing such a specification, several factors need to be considered—for instance, the model’s audience.
Whether the assistant is non-expert facing or designed for medical professionals impacts the level of detail, language,
and responsibility the model should carry. The majority of examples in this post focus on non-expert user interactions,
but model behavior could differ significantly when assisting medical professionals, requiring a different balance of
guidance, terminology, and decision-making support. Ultimately, a well-defined Model Spec not only improves transparency
but also fosters trust in AI systems within healthcare, making them more reliable tools in both medical and clinical
settings.
